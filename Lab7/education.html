                <h2>Swami Vivekananda International School</h2>
                   <p>There were many subjects that I liked but one of my favourite classses in schools was the Maths class. The professor was good in his topics and was a entertainer made me love maths.</p>
                <aside>
                    One of the best memory from the school was that I won 400m in my school's sports day. It was memorable since there were 4 houses andd i was in blue house which never won a gold medal ever.

                <h2>SMT. Shanti Devi Shukla Jr. College of Science</h2>
                   <p>My favourite class in my Jr. college was Computer Hardwares. The professor was knowledgeable and used to bring original 8085 processor in the classroom to have much better knowledge about the subject.  </p>
                <aside>
                    I enjoyed a lot in my Jr. college and attendance was not quite that important. So me and my group often used to bunk and go to many places in Mumbai. Mainly were beaches and food joints I didn't score that well in exams later but yes I had most fun as a student in Jr. college XD.

               <h2>Atharva College of Engineering</h2>
                  <p>My favourite class in my undergrad was Computer Graphics. I learned a lot in the class and the project given by the processor was very interesting. I made a very basic graphic based puzzle game.</p>
               <aside>
                   I used to have industrial visits every year and I used to visit different beautiful places in India and also visit many big IT companies. But one memorable one was the final year Industrial visit where me and my friends went rafting in a river which had almost speed of 40kmph and we weren't experts we did have a guide with us but still out boat flipped we fell in the river and it was quite freezing at that time in North India.
